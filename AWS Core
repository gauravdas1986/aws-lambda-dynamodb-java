Our fromt page lf scroll down a
littie bit you can see this sectior
called Explore Our Products and it
places all of the produdts arnd
services into diterent categorie For
eKampie if icick Eompute can see
Armazon EC2 as the first on the list
Dut a lotof other produtts and
show up in thE Comi
Category
If I were to click Amazon1
EC2 mair page which happeIS to
have the URE
upaws.anazon.com. EL2
gives you kind of an openng
more detailed deScription, and it
lists some of the benefits
Additionaly, along this rOW, we can
See product details, instance types
pricing, getting started, frequenty
ed qustions, and other
resources. If I click Product
Detais, you get some more
information about Amazon EC2
functionality. I'mgoing to go back
to that front page and click
Storage, and under Storage we
can see Amazon S Amazon EBS
and so forth. Lot of other storage
options would appear here.
Under Database we can sSe
a, Anazon RDS Amazo
DynamoDB Amazon Redshift, and
some oi the other options I we
want to fnd Amazon VPCit actually
shows up under Compute because
it is a required componentin orde
to isolate your compute resources.
and it shows up under Networking
&Content Delivery we gO to
Security, Identity, &
Compliance, we can see AWS
dentity & ACcess Management
lm dicking on that which can give
US sOme moCniormauon here
What ld like to do now is talk about
documentation, and this is really
well documented. 1 can scroll up to
the top and instead of exploring the
products, we can go rightinto more
documentation. We can get end
User doCumentation for any
product fyou notice have not
logged in to the console So l'm
accessing this just as a publicuser
Amazon EC2, and you have all the
documentation, User quide for
Linux, for Windows Ne API
reference, the AVWS CLI reference.
This is fantasticstuff here, and this
is going to be available for most
anything that we have. So now in
the documentation, I can select
Products, Storage, s3
Documentation such as Getting
Started Guide, Developer Guide, and
SO forth



The AWS doud offers pay as you
go, on -demand compute as well as
managed services all accessible via
he web. lhese compute resources
and services must be acessible via
normal 1P protOCols implemented
with familiar network structures
Customers need to adhere to
networking best practices as well aS
meet regulatory and organizationa
requirements. Amazon Virtual
Private Cloud, or VPC, is the
networking AWS service that will
meet your networking requirements.
Amazon VPC allows you to createa
private network within the AWS
Cloud that uses many of the samne
Concepts and constructs as an onn-
premises network but as we shall
see later, mudh ol the complexity of

Amazon VPCalsO gives you

items such as IP address spaces
subnets, and routing tables. This
allows you to control what you
expose to the internet and what you
ISolate Within the Amazon VPC You
Can deploy your Amazon VPC in a
way to layer security controls in the
network. This includes isolating
Subnets, defining accesS contropl
ists, and customizing routing rLles.
YOu have complete control to allow
and deny both incoming and
Outgoing traiic. Finally, there are
numerous AWS services that deploy
into your Amazon VPC that then
inherit and take advantage of the
Security hat you have built into
your coud network
Amazon VPCis an Aws
foundational service and integrat

Let's take a look at the features of
Amazon VPC Amazon VPC builds
Lpon the AS global infrastucture
of Reqions and Avaitabiliv Zone
and alows you to easiy take
advantage of the hiqh availability
provided by the AWS doud. Amazon
VPCS live within regions and can
span acrOss muitiple Avaitability
Zones Each AWS account can create
multipte VPCS that can be uUsed to
Segregate environmentL AVPO
defines an P address space that is
then divided by subrets These
subnets are denloved within
Avaitabiliby Å¾ones, causing the VPe
tO Span Avalablit Zones
Yau can create many subnets in a
VPC though fewer is recommended
to limit the complexity of the
netwok topology, but this is totally
up to yOu. You an configure route
tables for your Subnets to control
the traffic between subnets and the
Internet By default all Subnets
wiETnaVPeaan communicate with
each other Subnets are generaly
dassihed as pubic or private with
pubic having direct access to thg
internet and private nothaving
direct access to the internet for a
subnet to be public we need to
attach an internet gateway to the
VPCand update the route table of
the public subnet to send non tOcal
traffic to the internet gateway
Amazon EC2 instances also need a
Dubic IP address to route to an
Internet gateway
Lets design an example Amazon
VPC that we can use to start
deploying compute resources and
AWS services. VWe'll create a network
